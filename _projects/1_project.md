**Bottom Line:** Developed and deployed computer vision models for three critical transportation safety applications: traffic sign detection, human-car detection, and PPE compliance monitoring, achieving high precision (93-96%) across all safety-critical categories.

Computer vision technology has revolutionized transportation safety by enabling automated detection and monitoring systems that can process visual information faster and more consistently than human observers. This project explores three key applications of computer vision in the transportation sector, demonstrating the practical implementation of deep learning models for real-world safety challenges.

## Understanding Computer Vision

Computer vision enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from images, similar to human visual perception but with enhanced consistency and speed. The technology works through deep neural networks that learn to recognize patterns by training on labeled datasets.

The learning process involves feeding thousands of labeled images to the neural network, which gradually learns to identify key features. Hidden layers in the network extract increasingly complex features - from simple edges and textures in early layers to complete objects like eyes, faces, or vehicle parts in deeper layers.

## Project Applications

### Traffic Sign Detection

The first application focused on automated traffic sign recognition using the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark dataset with over 50,000 images. The system can identify and classify various traffic signs including prohibitory signs, danger signs, mandatory signs, and other regulatory signage.

    </div>

**Performance Results:**

| Sign Category | Precision | Recall |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| Prohibitory Signs | 96% | 89% |
| Danger Signs | 93% | 89% |
| Mandatory Signs | 95% | 91% |
| Other Signs | 93% | 82% |

**Key Applications:**
- Autonomous vehicles interpreting road signs for navigation
- Driver assistance systems providing real-time alerts  
- Traffic management systems ensuring road safety compliance

### Human-Car Detection

The second application developed a real-time detection system for identifying humans and vehicles in traffic scenarios. Using a dataset of 63,146 instances (50,518 training, 6,314 validation, 6,314 testing), the model can simultaneously detect and track both pedestrians and vehicles in complex urban environments.

**Applications:**
- Real-time traffic monitoring and analysis
- Traffic flow optimization for urban planning
- Pedestrian safety systems at intersections

### PPE Detection System

The third and most comprehensive application focuses on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) detection for construction and road work safety. This system can identify whether workers are wearing required safety equipment including helmets, safety vests, and other protective gear.

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

The dataset consists of 3,200 instances (2,991 training, 119 validation, 90 testing) with detection categories for:
- Helmet presence/absence
- Safety vest presence/absence  
- Person identification

    </div>
</div>

- Training and awareness programs
- Regulatory compliance documentation

## Technical Implementation

The models utilize state-of-the-art object detection architectures optimized for real-time performance. The gradual learning process allows the networks to build hierarchical representations of visual features, from basic edges and textures to complex object shapes and contexts.

## Impact and Future Development

This work represents a significant advancement in automated safety monitoring for transportation infrastructure. The high precision rates (93-96%) across all critical safety categories demonstrate the readiness of these systems for real-world deployment.

**Current Status:** The PPE detection model has been successfully deployed to HuggingFace and is actively being used for safety compliance monitoring. The project continues to expand with additional safety applications and improved model performance.

The integration of computer vision in transportation safety represents a paradigm shift toward proactive, automated safety systems that can operate continuously and consistently, significantly reducing the risk of accidents and improving overall transportation infrastructure safety.
