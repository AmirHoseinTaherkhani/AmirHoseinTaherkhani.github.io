I am a PhD candidate and experienced ML Engineer with over 5 years of hands-on experience in machine learning research. Currently pursuing my PhD at the University of New Hampshire while simultaneously earning my M.Sc. in Computer Science with from Georgia Institute of Technology.

My research focuses on AI-enabled urban decision-making, from infrastructure optimization to policy implementation. I have published multiple peer-reviewed papers in top-tier journals and developed production-ready ML systems that have achieved significant cost reductions and performance improvements in real-world applications.

**Key Achievements:**
- 52% operational cost reduction through Deep Reinforcement Learning
- 96% mAP real-time object tracking system
- Multiple publications in top-tier journals

**Technical Expertise:**
- Machine Learning
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Urban Analytics & AI Policy

I am open to research collaborations and opportunities in ML engineering roles where I can apply my expertise in computer vision and production ML systems.
